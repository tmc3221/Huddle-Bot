# Huddle-Bot
Huddle-Bot is your all-in-one AI-powered fantasy football assistant designed to help you dominate your league.

## DESIGN
### Initial Design:
- **data_loader.py**: For loading and cleaning data.
- **feature_engineering.py**: To create features for the model.
- **model.py**: To train the machine learning model.
- **evaluate_model.py**: To evaluate the model performance.
- **recommendations.py**: Make recomendations.
- **requirements.txt**: To list dependencies.
- **main.py**: Runs model.
- **collect.py**: Collects the necessary data.
